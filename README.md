# simple_js_clock
A simple clock just to keep testing my newbie JavaScript skills.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to build it.

Special thanks to "Dev Material" for the super simple explanation on his YouTube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2bLPOviyaw (I did the clock in a "watch and code" style).
